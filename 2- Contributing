Contributing to AIForge

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AIForge! We welcome contributions from developers, testers, and anyone passionate about enhancing the security and usability of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Whether you’re fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your contributions will help make this project even better.

This document provides guidelines for contributing to AIForge, including how to submit a pull request, report issues, and follow the coding standards.

How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to AIForge:
	•	Bug Fixes: If you find a bug or issue, you can submit a bug report or, even better, a pull request with a fix.
	•	New Features: We are always open to new features and improvements. If you have an idea, create an issue to discuss it or submit a pull request.
	•	Documentation: Help improve our documentation by clarifying existing content or adding new sections.
	•	Testing: You can test new features and provide valuable feedback. Reporting bugs is also a crucial part of our workflow.

Steps for Contributing

1. Fork the Repository

The first step to contributing is forking the repository to your own GitHub account.
	•	Go to the AIForge GitHub repository and click the “Fork” button in the top right corner of the page.
	•	Once the repository is forked, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIForge.git



2. Create a New Branch

To keep the repository clean, create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you want to work on. This helps to separate changes and makes the review process smoother.

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

Or, if you’re fixing a bug:

git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-name

3. Make Your Changes

Now you’re ready to make changes. Some things to keep in mind:
	•	Code Style: Follow the coding conventions used in the existing codebase. This helps maintain consistency.
	•	Documentation: Ensure that you update or add relevant documentation when making changes. For example, if you add a new feature, describe how to use it in the README.md or create new documentation in the docs/ folder.
	•	Testing: Write unit tests for any new features or bug fixes you add. This is essential for keeping the project stable.
	•	Commit Messages: Write clear and concise commit messages. Use the following format:

git commit -m "Add new feature: description of feature"



4. Push Your Changes

Once you’ve made and committed your changes, push your branch to your forked repository:

git push origin feature/your-feature-name

5. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Now that your changes are pushed, you can create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main repository.
	•	Go to the original repository (not your fork) on GitHub.
	•	You will see a prompt asking if you want to create a pull request. Click “Compare & pull request.”
	•	Add a descriptive title and a detailed message explaining your changes.
	•	Click “Create pull request.”

6. Review Process

Once your pull request is created, the maintainers will review your code. They may ask for changes or approve the PR. Please be responsive and make necessary updates based on their feedback.

Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to follow our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful and inclusive to all contributors, regardless of their experience or background.

Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in AIForge, please report it by following these steps:
	1.	Check for Existing Issues: Before creating a new bug report, search through the existing issues to see if someone else has already reported it.
	2.	Provide a Detailed Description: When creating a new issue, provide as much information as possible, including:
	•	Steps to reproduce the bug
	•	Expected and actual behavior
	•	Any relevant error messages or logs
	•	Your environment (e.g., operating system, Solana version, frontend setup)
You can report bugs by navigating to the Issues section of the repository and clicking “New Issue.”

Guidelines for New Features

If you want to add a new feature or improvement to AIForge, please follow these steps:
	1.	Open an Issue: Before starting on a new feature, open an issue describing the feature you want to implement. This helps others understand the proposal and avoid redundant work.
	2.	Discuss the Feature: Engage with maintainers and other contributors to discuss the feasibility and requirements of the feature.
	3.	Design & Documentation: When implementing the feature, make sure to write clear documentation on how it works and how users can interact with it.
	4.	Unit Tests: For new features, ensure that there are unit tests that validate the feature’s correctness and prevent future regressions.

Code Style & Best Practices
	•	Use Modern JavaScript/TypeScript: Write clean, modern JavaScript or TypeScript (depending on the project’s stack).
	•	Use ESLint & Prettier: Adhere to standard coding styles by using ESLint for JavaScript linting and Prettier for code formatting.
	•	Modularize Code: Keep code modular and reusable. If you add new functions, try to make them small and focused on one responsibility.

Additional Resources
	•	Solana Documentation: Learn how to interact with Solana using the SDK.
	•	Rust Documentation: Learn more about developing on Solana using Rust.
	•	React Documentation: Learn more about developing the frontend using React.
