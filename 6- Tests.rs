Here’s the full 6- tests/ section in English, with proper structure and content:

6. tests/

The tests directory contains all test cases for the AIForge platform. These tests ensure the reliability, security, and functionality of its components through unit and integration testing.

Directory Structure

/tests
│
├── unit              # Unit tests for individual functions and modules
├── integration       # Integration tests for overall system behavior
└── README.md         # Documentation for writing and running tests

1. unit/

Description: Unit tests verify the functionality of individual functions or modules in isolation, ensuring their behavior is as expected.

Example File: unit/contract_test.rs

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_process_instruction() {
        let program_id = Pubkey::new_unique();
        let accounts = vec![];
        let instruction_data = vec![];

        let result = process_instruction(&program_id, &accounts, &instruction_data);
        assert!(result.is_ok(), "Instruction failed unexpectedly.");
    }
}

2. integration/

Description: Integration tests verify the interaction between multiple modules or components to ensure the entire system works as expected.

Example File: integration/api_test.js

const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../api/app');

describe('API Integration Tests', () => {
    it('should return alerts when monitoring a contract', async () => {
        const response = await request(app)
            .post('/monitor')
            .send({ contractAddress: 'SampleAddress' });

        expect(response.status).toBe(200);
        expect(response.body.alerts).toContain("Potential suspicious activity detected");
    });
});

# AIForge Tests

The `tests/` directory contains all test cases for the AIForge platform, ensuring its stability, security, and functionality.

## Structure

- **unit/**: Contains unit tests for individual components.
- **integration/**: Contains integration tests to verify the interactions between different modules.

## How to Run Tests

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install     # For JavaScript tests
   cargo build     # For Rust-based tests

	2.	Run Unit Tests
	•	JavaScript:

npm test


	•	Rust:

cargo test


	3.	Run Integration Tests
Integration tests require the backend to be running:

npm run start   # Start the backend
npm test        # Run integration tests



Writing Tests
	•	Unit Tests: Test individual functions or modules in isolation. Use mocking frameworks if dependencies are required.
	•	Integration Tests: Test the flow between multiple components to ensure they work together as expected.

Example Commands
	•	Run all tests:

npm test && cargo test


	•	Run a specific test file:

npm test -- tests/integration/api_test.js
cargo test -- test_process_instruction



For detailed guidelines, refer to the Documentation.

### **Key Notes for This Section**

1. **Purpose**:  
   - Ensure every part of the AIForge platform performs as intended.
   - Detect and fix issues early in development.

2. **Languages and Frameworks Used**:  
   - **Rust** for smart contract tests.
   - **JavaScript** and **Supertest** for API and integration testing.

3. **How to Add Tests**:  
   - Add unit tests for new features or modules in `/tests/unit`.
   - Write integration tests to cover interactions across modules in `/tests/integration`.

This version is complete and uses clear English for both structure and explanations. Let me know if anything needs further refinement!
