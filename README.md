AIForge Blockchain Security Tools

AIForge provides a suite of AI-powered tools designed to enhance security and protect users from fraud in the blockchain space. These tools include a smart contract generator, an anti-rug bot, and an audit tool. The platform offers secure and transparent solutions without the need for coding knowledge.

Features
	•	Smart Contract Generator: An AI-powered tool that generates secure, custom smart contracts without any coding.
	•	Anti-Rug Bot: Detects and prevents fraud in DeFi projects by automatically flagging suspicious behavior and blocking transactions.
	•	Audit Tool: Performs automated security audits on smart contracts to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

Installation

Follow the steps below to install the AIForge tools on your system:

Requirements
	•	Rust: For developing Solana programs.
	•	Solana CLI: The command-line interface for Solana.
	•	Node.js (optional for frontend integration).

Installation Steps
	1.	Install Rust:
Follow the official installation guide: Rust Installation.
	2.	Install Solana CLI:
Follow the official installation guide: Solana CLI Installation.
	3.	Clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIForge
cd AIForge


	4.	Install dependencies:
If there is a frontend, install necessary dependencies using npm or yarn:

npm install


	5.	Build and deploy:
To deploy the smart contract generator or the anti-rug bot to Solana:

cargo build-bpf --release
solana program deploy /target/deploy/your_program.so



Usage

Smart Contract Generator

The Smart Contract Generator allows you to create custom smart contracts with AI by simply inputting your desired parameters (such as tokenomics). No coding is required.

Example usage:

solana program run generate_contract --tokenomics 1000000 --name "MyToken"

Anti-Rug Bot

The Anti-Rug Bot protects against DeFi rug pulls by detecting suspicious behavior and blocking transactions before they occur.

Example usage:

solana program run anti_rug --address <contract_address> --block suspicious_tx

Audit Tool

The Audit Tool performs automated security audits on smart contracts. It identifies vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks, overflows, and other common smart contract issues.

Example usage:

solana program run audit_contract --address <contract_address>
