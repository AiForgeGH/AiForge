5. src

The src directory contains the core source code for the AIForge platform. It’s structured to make development intuitive and scalable. Below is the breakdown of the structure and sample files.

Directory Structure

/src
│
├── contracts       # Solana smart contract source code
├── api             # API endpoints and backend logic
├── frontend        # React-based frontend code
├── utils           # Helper functions and reusable components
└── tests           # Unit and integration tests

1. contracts/

Description: Contains Solana smart contracts written in Rust. These contracts handle blockchain functionality like transactions, token operations, and security checks.

Example File: example_contract.rs

use solana_program::{
    account_info::AccountInfo,
    entrypoint,
    entrypoint::ProgramResult,
    msg,
    pubkey::Pubkey,
};

entrypoint!(process_instruction);

fn process_instruction(
    _program_id: &Pubkey,
    _accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    _instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    msg!("Hello from AIForge smart contract!");
    Ok(())
}

2. api/

Description: Contains backend logic and API endpoints for interacting with the smart contracts and handling user requests.

Example File: monitor.js

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// API endpoint to monitor a contract
router.post('/monitor', async (req, res) => {
    const { contractAddress } = req.body;
    try {
        // Example logic for detecting suspicious activity
        const alerts = ["Potential suspicious activity detected"];
        res.json({ status: "success", alerts });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ status: "error", message: error.message });
    }
});

module.exports = router;

3. frontend/

Description: Contains the code for the user interface, built with React.

Example File: App.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
    const [alerts, setAlerts] = useState([]);

    const monitorContract = async () => {
        const response = await fetch('/api/monitor', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ contractAddress: 'SampleAddress' }),
        });
        const data = await response.json();
        setAlerts(data.alerts || []);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>AIForge Dashboard</h1>
            <button onClick={monitorContract}>Monitor Contract</button>
            <ul>
                {alerts.map((alert, index) => (
                    <li key={index}>{alert}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;

4. utils/

Description: Includes reusable helper functions that are used across the application.

Example File: helpers.js

export function truncateAddress(address) {
    return `${address.slice(0, 6)}...${address.slice(-4)}`;
}

5. tests/

Description: Contains unit and integration tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the tools.

Example File: example_test.js

const assert = require('assert');

describe('AIForge Tool Tests', () => {
    it('should detect suspicious activity alerts', () => {
        const mockAlerts = ["Suspicious activity detected"];
        assert.strictEqual(mockAlerts.length > 0, true);
    });
});

README in src

# AIForge Source Code

The source code for AIForge is organized into multiple directories, each serving a specific purpose.

## Directory Breakdown

- **contracts/**: Smart contracts for Solana written in Rust.
- **api/**: Backend APIs that interact with the blockchain and frontend.
- **frontend/**: React-based user interface for interacting with the tools.
- **utils/**: Reusable helper functions and shared logic.
- **tests/**: Automated tests for unit and integration scenarios.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the appropriate directory for your work:
   - To edit smart contracts, go to `contracts/`.
   - To update backend logic, check `api/`.
   - To modify the frontend, visit `frontend/`.

2. Follow the [Setup Guide](../docs/setup.md) to run the project locally.

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test

For further details, visit the Documentation.
